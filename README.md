# Zero Point (Previously Citizen Connect)

# Vision

We aim to empower the citizens of Islamabad with a mobile-first approach to government communication and services. ZeroPoint, a mobile app available on both Android and iPhone, is a humble step to digitally transform government service delivery in Islamabad using a citizen-centric approach.

# Short Term

Code for Pakistan with the help of citizens and support of ICT Admin will develop an MVP on build-operate-transfer model. Primary users for the MVP are local residents. In the future versions, visitors or out of city Islamabadis will also be catered. Primary goals are (1) to ensure citizen receive authentic and timely information, and (2) to save citizenâ€™s time. Therefore, MVP primary focus is government notification and citizen feedback. However, some ground work will also be done to ensure core functionality is there to provision digital services in the future to support goals such as: efficient service delivery, inclusive citizen participation, enhanced citizen engagement etc.

# Long Term

City government can use learning from the MVP to build a case (PC1?) to launch digital services at scale in Islamabad. City government will need a service provider and it could be NITB or it can be a private entity as per relevant public procurement processes. The service provider will have full option to leverage open source code behind MVP. Code for Pakistan will continue to provide oversight if required by ICT Admin to ensure best practices around user centered design and civic tech are employed.
